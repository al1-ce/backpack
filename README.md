## Usage

Backpack keeps configuration in `~/.config/backpack/backup_list` in format `absolutePath:originName:branchName`.

- To add new path to list use `--add`, `-a` flag. You also can set custom origin with `--origin`, `-o` and custom branch with `--branch`, `-B`, otherwise origin of `origin` and branch `master` will be assumed.
- To remove existing path use `--remove`, `-r` flag.
- To start backup use `--backup`, `-b` flag.

Example:
```
Add current folder to paths:
backpack -a .

Add folder to path with custom branch and origin:
backpack -B main -o customOriginAlias -a projectFolder

Remove current folder from paths:
backpack -r .

Backup all:
backpack -b
```
